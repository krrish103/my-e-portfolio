<p1>Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World health organization on 11th March 2020. Since then, it has greatly disrupted normal life and caused a change in the lifestyle of people. 
Offices and schools were shut down, global air travel was restricted, lockdowns were announced. This caused lifestyle changes to everyone across the globe. 
<br><br>During the lockdown times, students were attending schools from the comfort of their houses, thereby saving travel daily time of 1-2 hours. I decided to use this precious time saved, to learn new skills. In my E-Portfolio, I have shared some things that I have learnt in the academic year 2020-2021.</br></br>
</p1>
<ul>
<li>Programming:- Programming is one of my most favourite things to do. I had learnt programming from IBM courses provided by the school and classes taken by Valsamma ma'am. I have created an app and a game using my learned skills. Below is the image of all my badges that I received from IBM for the courses I completed.

<br>I have also created a game on scratch titled " Catch the fruit ". Read the instructions and enjoy playing it.</br>
<b>
<br>Instructions:-</br>
<br>Left Key to move left</br>
<br>Right Key to move right</br>
<br>Green flag to start</br>
<br>Red octagon to stop</br>
<br>Note:- The game will automatically end after 45 seconds</br>

<br>I also created a chatbot using IBM cloud. Below is a recording of my conversation with my chatbot.</br>

<li>Robotics:- It helped me develop problem solving skills and creativity. 
I had worked on a robot called mbot.
 I learnt how to assemble it, program it, and use various sensors.
 I learnt how to program it using mblock 5 software. 
In the app, I was able to program it using blocks or Arduino C language. 
I understood the working of various sensors such as ultrasonic sensor, line follower sensor, touch sensor, light sensor and temperature sensor and how they can be integrated into robots to make our daily lives easier. I have attached a video for your reference to show what my robot can do.
